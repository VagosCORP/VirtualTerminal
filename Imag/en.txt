Use Bluetooth/WiFi to control any hobby or professional project

Virtual Terminal let user begin a socket based communication through wireless protocols, featuring both WiFi and Bluetooth, available in most android devices. Other side of communication can be a MCU or Arduino with the proper wireless hardware (HC-06 module as example for bluetooth), another app or PC software providing a server to connect to.
This app was developed thinking in hobby and/or professional embedded projects, searching a rich and flexible graphical user interface, letting user control and debug his work as fast and comfortable as possible.
Virtual Terminal include next configurable features:
• Send String as Bytes
• Send Integer as Byte
• Send Integer as Byte(Binary input)
• Send Integer as Byte(Hexadecimal input)
• New Advanced Sending options:
  - Send 16bit Integer as 2 Bytes
  - Send signed 32bit Integer as 4 Bytes
  - Send signed Float number as 4 Bytes (32bit)
• Auto Scroll of receive section (RX)
• Receive Bytes as Characters (ASCII)
• Receive Bytes as Integers
• Receive Bytes as both Characters and Integers with new 'Dual' option
• Receive constantly changing information and see it been updated at real time with the new 'Update' option
  - Requires "\n" ending on incoming Data
  - New data string will overlap actual data, allowing a high actualization rate
  - '#Act' Input let you accumulate and see more than one received String at a time
• New Advanced Receiving options: (Needs data start with \r and end with \n)
  - Receive signed 16bit Integer as 2 Bytes
  - Receive signed 32bit Integer as 4 Bytes
  - Receive signed Float number as 4 Bytes (32bit)
• Enhanced Commander Mode:
  - Enable a group of configurable command buttons
  - Long Click to save command from TX input (empty input will erase existing command)
  - Single Click to send saved data
  - Command buttons will show value and type of saved data (Text, Binary, Float, etc.)
• Theme selector, enabling a 'Dark' theme to protect your eyes

Notes:
- Bluetooth: Pair device you wish to work with (Android Bluetooth settings) before use.
- WiFi: Must know IP and Port information of device before using it.
